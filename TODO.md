# TODO

+ Optionally auto hide and reveal the autoComplete container within the manager.
+ Smart autoComplete that not only filters, but knows which is a better match.
+ ~~Need to test assigning the trigger cell when the cell is not available from NIB.~~
+ Add UITableView and UITableViewCell customization ability for the user via UIAppearance proxy.
+ Should probably pass the tableView to the user the first time a trigger appears (and remove trigger.cellClass/cellNIB)
+ Raise exception or handle gracefully if the user sent an array of strings for the component.
+ explore linking the autoCompleteMgr to the user through KVO.
+ Write a better README.
